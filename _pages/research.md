### "Garment Manufacturing and Women’s Work, Reproduction, and Human Capital Accumulation"
### *Job Marker Paper*

**Abstract:** Within the past 30 years, Bangladesh emerged as the second largest exporter of garments. This industry has since given millions of Bangladeshi women their first opportunity for non-farm employment. I estimate the long-term effect of this increased employment opportunities on female labor force participation (FLFP), reproductive, and human capital accumulation choices of Bangladeshi women by employing a Bartik-style instrument. Specifically, I use variation in employment opportunities arising from differences in product specialization within areas with RMG factories. I find that increased exposure to the garment industry leads to a large increase in FLFP, and a small decline in school enrollment among working age teenage girls. However, I find no impact on marriage rates, fertility rates, literacy and overall years of schooling.

### "The Fertility Transition in Bangladesh"

**Abstract:** I first document the onset of fertility transition in rural and urban Bangladesh using birth histories of women different nationally representative surveys conducted between 1976-2018. I find that the onset of the fertility transition can be dated to 1970-75 in urban areas, and to 1975-80 in rural areas. In addition to the usual correlates of realized fertility, I find that participation in land-owning agriculture is associated with increased fertility. In future, exogenous variation in land availability, or structural models will be used to further understand the mechanism of rural fertility transition in Bangladesh

## Work in Progress

### “The Inter-relationship between Fertility and Female Labor Force Transitions”

**Abstract:** Limited data suggests that in the case of Bangladesh, reductions in fertility were followed, with some lag, by an increase in FLFP, especially in the non-farm sector. The objective of this paper is to first systematically verify that there are lags between the onset of fertility transitions and FLFP transitions using Bangladeshi data. If  are lags, this paper will attempt to identify the key characteristics of economic development that can explain the lag in FLFP transition following a fertility transition.
