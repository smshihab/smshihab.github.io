### "Garment Manufacturing and Women’s Work, Reproduction, and Human Capital Accumulation"
### *Job Marker Paper*

**Abstract:** Over the past thirty years, Bangladesh has emerged as the second largest exporter of garments in the world. The industry has given millions of Bangladeshi women their first opportunity for non-farm employment. I estimate the long-term effect of this increased employment opportunities on female labor force participation (FLFP), fertility and marriage behavior, and schooling of Bangladeshi women by employing a Bartik-style instrument. Specifically, I use variation in employment opportunities arising from differences in product specialization within areas with RMG factories. I find that increased exposure to the garment industry led to a large increase in FLFP, and a small decline in school enrollment among working age teenage girls. However, I find no impact on marriage rates, fertility rates, literacy and overall years of schooling.

### "The Fertility Transition in Bangladesh"

**Abstract:** Bangladesh saw a decline of roughly 5 births per woman between 1970-2020. Policy reports and commentaries often credit successful family planning programs for this fertility transition, and the role of economic conditions remains relatively unexamined. I combine retrospective birth history data from several rounds of nationally representative surveys to estimate age-specific completed fertility rates. My estimates suggest that rural transition in Bangladesh started in late 1970s, quickly followly the urban transition that started in early 1970s. I find that land-owning famers experienced a slower decline. This finding, coupled with the population explosion in prior decades, suggests an important role of land-constraint in initiating fertility transitions in rural Bangladesh. The next phase of this research project will employ a structural model to further understand the mechanism of fertility transition in rural Bangladesh.

## Work in Progress

### “The Inter-relationship between Fertility and Female Labor Force Transitions”

**Abstract:** Aggregate data suggests that in the case of Bangladesh, reductions in fertility were followed by an increase in FLFP with some lag, especially in the non-farm sector. The first objective of this paper is to verify using detailed micro-data that onset of fertility transitions is followed by FLFP transitions. Second, this paper will attempt to identify the key elements of economic development that can explain the lag between FLFP transition and fertility transitions.
