I am an energy economist specializing in the intersection of Economertics, data analytics, policy, and clean-energy transformation. I am a Principal Consultant at Opinion Dynamics, where I work in evaluations of energy-efficiency, demand-response, transportation-electrification, energy finance, and grid-based energy savings programs for regulated and public utilities across the United States. Currnetly also completing a Clean Energy Leadership Institute (CELI) fellowship.

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Oregon, where I specialized in applied econometrics, development economics, and demography. My dissertation investigated the economic forces behind fertility decline during periods of structural transformation. It examines how industrialization, urbanization, and changes in rural economic conditions alter the incentives for childbearing by reshaping returns to labor and human capital.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, learning about history, playing soccer, badminton, and trying new food!
