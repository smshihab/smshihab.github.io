I am an energy economist specializing in the intersection of data analytics, policy, and clean-energy transformation. I am a Principal Consultant at Opinion Dynamics, where I work in evaluations of energy-efficiency, demand-response, transportation-electrification, energy finance, and grid-based energy savings programs for regulated and public utilities across the United States.

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Oregon, where I specialized in applied econometrics, development economics, and demography. My dissertation investigates the economic forces behind fertility decline during periods of structural transformation. It examines how industrialization, urbanization, and changes in rural economic conditions alter the incentives for childbearing by reshaping returns to labor and human capital. Across three studies, I analyze how shifts in labor demand, land constraints, and educational opportunities contribute to fertility transitionsâ€”offering broader insights into the macroeconomic and demographic mechanisms that drive population change in developing economies.
